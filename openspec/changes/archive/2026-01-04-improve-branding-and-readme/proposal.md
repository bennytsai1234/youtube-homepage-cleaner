# Change: Improve Branding and README

## Why
The current `README.md` is functional but lacks visual impact. The project name "YouTube Homepage Cleaner" is generic, while the script source code uses the stronger brand "YouTube Purifier". Additionally, the "Star this repo" call-to-action can be made more prominent to increase user engagement.

## What Changes
- Add a high-quality "Before vs After" banner image to visually demonstrate the script's value.
- Refine description: Change "Block Ads" to "Hide Ad Banners" or "Clean Layout" to avoid misleading users about video ad blocking.
- Unify English branding to "YouTube Cleaner".
- Enhance the visual prominence of the "Star this project" call-to-action.
- Add a direct link to GreasyFork for alternative installation.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `documentation`
- Affected code: `README.md`
